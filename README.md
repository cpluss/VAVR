VAVR
===========================================
VAVR stands for VGA-AVR, which is the name of this project.
The main goal of this project is to handle the drawing to a computerscreen using a single mcu (microcontroller unit).

NOTE: VAVR is a final year school-project, the report and logs will be in swedish.

The choice of mcu in this case were the ATMEGA48PA
* It had enough pins
* It could handle a clock signal of 20MHz
* It simply was enough ! :)

This will be updated soon, when I have found a suitable license and finished it :)
