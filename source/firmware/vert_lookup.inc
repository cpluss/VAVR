/*
Vertical line lookup matrix
	Used to easier have a control of the fLO in the video interrupt routine
	rather than to compare values on the fly... The control bits specify
	when we do things :)

	Bit meanings:
		0 - Reset vertical address and Reset the vertical line counter
		1 - Vertical sync control
		2 - Is this a active pixel line?
		3 - Increment vertical address
		4 - Memory write ready
